# CAR SHOP

Online vehicle sales application using Laravel. Anyone registered may post a vehicle up to a particular level of detail. Ads must be allowed by the admin before they become active. Authorized users can mark their cars as sold, add cars to their wish lists, and set, modify, and remove cars. Administrators get access to a list of every car, including the ones that have been sold and other details about cars

-------------

The application is hosted on a free server (vercel.com) as well as a database (freesqldatabase.com). 

Because of the free host, the application might be slower and some features might not work.

## Here's how to run it locally:
###### (PHP, MySQL, and Composer must be installed.)


#### 1. CLONE REPOSITORY
#### 2. FIND DATABASE IN ROOT DIR
	set name for db: car_shop2
#### 3. RUN COMMAND IN CMD:  `composer install`
#### 4. RUN COMMAND IN CMD: `php artisan serve`
